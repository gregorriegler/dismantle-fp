Functional Callisthenics
========================

* Side effects can only occur at the top level
* No mutable state/ Immutable Objects
* Expressions not statements and always use the return value
* Functions should have 1 argument
* No explicit recursion ? use a map or fold instead
* Maximum type-level abstraction
  e.g. most generic argument types
  e.g. Make your functions as generic as possible
* Always use infinite sequences
* No if
* Name everything (Provide named types for primitives including tuples.)
* Use intermediates
* Don't abbreviate
